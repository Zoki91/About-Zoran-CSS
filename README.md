This weekâ€™s task was to create a portfolio of work which can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.
In this Challenge it will set you up for future success by applying the core skills weâ€™ve recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I got to practice these new skills while creating something that I will use during your job search. It's a win-win that I will likely be grateful for in the future!
